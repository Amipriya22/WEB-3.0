## How it works

The program defines a Car class that has the following attributes and methods:

- Attributes: make, model, year, speed, x, y, angle, velocity
- Methods: accelerate, brake, move, detect_collision, time_to_collision

The Car class uses the math module to perform calculations involving trigonometry and vectors.

The main program creates two instances of the Car class with different initial values and moves them for a certain amount of time. It then checks if they have collided or not, and prints the result.

## How to run it

To run the program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You can run the program from the command line by typing:

`python car_collision_simulator.py`

You can also run the program from an IDE or editor of your choice that supports Python.

## How to modify it

You can modify the program by changing the values of the variables in the main program. For example, you can change the make, model, year, speed, x, y, angle of the cars, or the duration of the simulation.

You can also modify the Car class by adding new attributes or methods, or changing the existing ones. For example, you can add a color attribute to the Car class, or change the formula for calculating the velocity.
